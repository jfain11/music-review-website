                    <div class="textbox"><p> My favorite album is Deadroses by Blackbear. I have a tattoo for this album, and it has been what I’ve turned to when I’m going through a lot for years. I would describe the genre of this album as pop, in a general sense. I love all the uses of the synths throughout this album. My favorite song on Deadroses is a tie between ‘my heart is lost,’ and ‘4u.’ The opening bass in ‘my heart is lost’ has given me chills on countless occasions, and ‘4u’ has helped me move through heartbreak more times than I can remember. While I think Blackbear has a discography with no bad songs, this album is what I have always turned to the most.</p></div>

                    <div class="textbox"><p>My favorite album is "Sublime" by Sublime. I have listened to this album countless times and really enjoy every song. My dad was a huge sublime fan growing up and it was through him that I was introduced to their music at a young age. I would describe their music as a mixture of rock and reggae, and many often refer to them as a ska-punk band. Their style is largely impacted by the fact the band originates from the west coast, specifically in California, which is clear as the music is very beachy and relaxing. </p></div>

                    <div class="textbox"><p>I really like Gone Troppo because it is different from other Harrison’s albums that he released. He goes outside what he normally writes by going with more synths and using more doubling of guitar parts. I really like the song “I Really Love You” it is interesting song that is this weird acapella hybrid song that has bass and drums in it but major of it is Singing that has all of the harmony which this has George sing it. This is a cover song was really The Stereos which is from the sixties. I also really love the song “Baby Don’t Run Away which is a beautiful love song that is slow and reminds of the song “Something” which this just beautiful song that I would put on repeat. In really love this album overall I would highly suggest to give it listen. </p></div>
